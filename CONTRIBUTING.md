# Contributing to HSR Optimizer

We'd love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Communication via discord

We use the #dev channel on discord https://discord.gg/rDmB4Un7qg for communication/questions. Responses on discord will generally be faster than Issues or comments.

## We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), so all code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Steps to create a pull request:

1. Fork the hsr-optimizer repo and create your personal branch from `beta`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints with `npm run lint`
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/fribbels/hsr-optimizer/issues)

Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fribbels/hsr-optimizer/issues/new).
Bugs should include reproduction steps, screenshots, and if possible, the metadata to reproduce the issue. Uploading the save file is helpful as well.

## Your first issue & pull request

- Check current issues in the [BACKLOG](https://github.com/users/fribbels/projects/2)
- Priority stack ranking and rough project status can be found in the [PRIORITY BOARD](https://github.com/users/fribbels/projects/2/views/2)
- Find an issue you're interested in and comment on it that it's in progress. Feel free to ping fribbels on the discord server as well to discuss any ambiguities.

After you have forked the repo and switched to the `beta` branch, create your working branch:

```
git checkout -b [feature|fix]/[your-branch-name]
```
