# I18n

If you come across any issues with the translation setup, just send a message

### Adding a new language

When adding a new language

- create a new locale file in `public/locales` if the appropriate one does not yet exist.
    - copy over the appropriate `gameData` file from a locale that already has it.
- add the new language to the list of languages in `src/lib/i18n/i18n.ts` if it does not already exist.
- once the translation has been completed, add the language to the list of completed languages in
  `src/lib/i18n/LanguageSelector.tsx`.

### Adding new text

When any displayed text is added to the webpage, it should be done directly through the i18n setup.

- Add the new translation strings in the relevant en yaml file
    - if a new file is necessary, make sure to add it to the loaded namespaces in `src/lib/i18n/i18n.ts`
- Leave the en translation next to the t function in the code as a code comment
  `const message = t('Thing.Messages.Success') /*'Operation successful'*/`
- **After modifying the translation files, execute `npm run update-resources` from the root directory.**

### Writing EN yaml files

Guidelines for writing yaml files in EN:

* Keep keys unquoted
* Keep strings unquoted if possible
* If quotes are needed, use double quotes
* If double quotes would need to be escaped or if the string is excessively long, use a yaml fold `>-`
* If the string contains special characters: e.g. `{` `}` `'` `"` `:` etc, make sure they are quoted or folded

When working with code, re-use the common namespace where possible.

**After modifying the translation files, execute `npm run update-resources` from the root directory.**

### Updating other files

Updating / writing the translations for languages other than english is done via crowdin.
Reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/YHCCaXEhfV) if you wish to help write the translations.

You will come across some translations that look like the following:
`"valueTextPart1 $t(namespace:key, {options}) valueTextPart2"`, this is used to reference an already existing
translation within a translation string.
In most cases, such a string will be translated as follows:
`"translatedValueTextPart1 $t(namespace:key, {options}) translatedValueTextPart2"`
however there may be some cases where you find it appropriate to modify the inner section as well.

Certain strings include double braced words

You will also see some translation strings include double braced words (*Immediately draws 2 jade tile(s) and increases
DMG by <u>**{{skillStackDmg}}**</u>% until the end of the current turn. This effect can stack up to 4 time(s).*).
These are used to inject a dynamic value into the translated string (e.g. a varying buff, or a number of relics,
etc...).
These should be left as is in the translation, but can be moved around as needed within the sentence.

Finally, some strings will have tags in them to allow for special formatting (e.g. `codeblocks` or **bold text**).
These strings will looks something like `"<0>someText</0>SomeMoreText"`.
When translating these, the tags surrounding a section of text indicate its formatting.
However, the segments don't need to enclosed within a tag. The example above could, for example, be translated as:
`"textTranslated <0>someTextTranslated</0><1>someMoreTextTranslated</1>"`.
This would allow `someTextTranslated` to have the same formatting as `someText` all while having something else precede
it in the sentence.

### Updating home page images

These images are from the default save file, cropped to webp 96% compression. I use gimp but anything works.

* #1 - 1602 x 1284 showcase image rescaled to 740 width
* #2 - Jingliu main page, add Bronya, Ruan Mei, Huohuo, + ATK boots + Genius set. Click the third result and crop the
  grid down to 740:593
* #3 - Browser zoom to 67% and crop the optimizer to 740:593
* #4 - Browser zoom to 67%, select Jingliu on relics tab and sort by selected avg potential, click the headpiece. Crop
  from Set to 740:593
