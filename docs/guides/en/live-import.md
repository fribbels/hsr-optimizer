# Live Import

## Instructions

- Download Reliquary Archiver: https://github.com/IceDynamix/reliquary-archiver/releases/latest
- Instead of double clicking the exe, you need to run it from a terminal
- Navigate to where the folder is
- In the file explorer top bar, type in `cmd`, this should open up a Command Prompt window
- Then type in `reliquary-archiver-XXX-x64.exe -s` into that window, replacing XXX with whatever is needed to match the name of your .exe
- Open and log into the game after running the command

## Troubleshooting

- Try turning off VPN if having issues
- Brave browser will block live import by default, must add an exception
- If the terminal opens in system32, navigate to the Downloads folder by typing in `cd "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads"` or modify to wherever the folder that the exe is in
- Make sure the scanner is open before logging into the game
