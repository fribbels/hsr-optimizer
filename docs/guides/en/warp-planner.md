# Warp Planner

## Settings

### Strategy

Choose a strategy to define which primary goal to target first.
After the first target, the assumed goal order is E0 -> S1 -> E6 -> S5.

```
E0 first // E0 -> S1 -> E6 -> S5
E1 first // E1 -> S1 -> E6 -> S5
E2 first // E2 -> S1 -> E6 -> S5
E3 first // E3 -> S1 -> E6 -> S5
E4 first // E4 -> S1 -> E6 -> S5
E5 first // E5 -> S1 -> E6 -> S5
E6 first // E6 -> S1 -> S5
S1 first // S1 -> E6 -> S5
```

### Average #

### Calculations

* Base character pull rate: 0.6%
* Base light cone pull rate: 0.8%
* Character success rate: 50% + (1/8 * 50%) = 56.25%
* Light Cone success rate: 75% + (1/8 * 75%) = 78.125%
