    Header: DPS Score Calculation
    WhatIsDPSScore: >-
      <0>What is DPS Score?</0><1>DPS Score is a damage calculation based metric for accurately scoring how optimal the character's relics are for maximizing
      damage in combat.</1><2>This score is calculated by using the optimizer to simulate the character's combat stats and rates the build based on how much the
      relics contribute to damage, for a more accurate evaluation than scores based solely on stat weights.</2><3>The scoring calculation takes into
      consideration:</3><4><0>Character eidolons / light cone / superimpositions</0><1>Teammate eidolons / light cone / superimpositions</1><2>Combat passives
      and buffs from abilities and light cones</2><3>Team composition and teammate buffs</3><4>Character ability rotations</4><5>Stat breakpoints</5><6>Stat
      overcapping</6><7>Relic set effects</7><8>Super break</8><9>...etc</9></4>
    HowIsCalculatedPart1: >-
      <0>How is it calculated?</0><1>At its heart, this score is calculated using a Basic / Skill / Ult / FuA / DoT / Break ability damage rotation predefined
      per character. These simulations use the optimizer's default conditional settings for the character / teammates / light cones / relic sets, and the damage
      sum is then used to compare between builds.</1><2>Simulation benchmarks</2><3>The scoring algorithm generates three builds to measure the damage of the
      original character against.</3><4><0>Baseline (0%) - No substats, no main stats</0><1>Benchmark (100%) - A strong build, generated following certain rules
      with a realistic distribution of 48x min rolls</1><2>Perfection (200%) - The perfect build, generated with an ideal distribution of 54x max rolled
      substats</2></4><5>The original character's build is scored based on how its Combo DMG compares to the benchmark percentages.The benchmark and perfection
      builds will always match the original character's SPD.</5>
    HowIsCalculatedPart2: >-
      <0>100% benchmark ruleset</0><1>The 100% benchmark character is designed to be a strong and realistic build that is difficult to reach, but attainable
      with some character investment into relic farming. The following ruleset defines how the build is generated and why it differs from the perfect
      build.</1><2><0>The default damage simulation uses a common team composition and the character's BiS relic + ornament set</0><1>The 100% benchmark uses
      the same eidolon and superimposition as the original character, at level 80 and maxed traces</1><2>The 100% benchmark has 4 main stats and 48 total
      substats: 8 from each gear slot</2><3>Each substat is equivalent to a 5 star relic's low roll value, except for SPD which uses mid rolls</3><4>First, 2
      substats are allocated to each substat type, except for SPD</4><5>Substats are then allocated to SPD to match the original character's in-combat
      SPD</5><6>The remaining substats are then distributed to the other stats options to maximize the build's damage output</6><7>The resulting build must be a
      substat distribution that is possible to make with the in-game sub and main stat restrictions (for example, relics with a main stat cannot also have the
      same substat, and no duplicate substat slots per piece, etc)</7><8>An artificial diminishing returns penalty is applied to substats with greater than
      <1>12 - (2 * main stats)</1> rolls, to simulate the difficulty of obtaining multiple rolls in a single stat</8></2><3>This process is repeated through all
      the possible main stat permutations and substat distributions until the highest damage simulation is found. That build's damage is then used as the
      standard for a 100% DPS Score.</3><4>200% benchmark ruleset</4><5>The 200% perfection character follows a similar generation process with a few
      differences.</5><6><0>54x max roll substats</0><1>No diminishing returns penalty</1><2>All substats are ideally distributed, but the build must still be
      possible to make</2></6>
    HowIsCalculatedPart3: >-
      <0>Score normalization</0><1>All simulation scores are normalized by deducting a baseline damage simulation. The baseline uses the same eidolon and light
      cone, but no main stats and no substats. This adjusts for the base amount of damage that a character's kit deals, so that the DPS Score can then measure
      the resulting damage contribution of each additional substat.</1><2>Relic / ornament sets</2><3>Each character has a defined BiS set, and a few other
      equivalent sets that can be considered similar in performance. If the original character's sets matches any of the acceptable sets, the character will be
      scored against a benchmark generated matching that set, otherwise the original character will be scored against the BiS.</3><4>Stat breakpoint
      penalty</4><5>Certain characters will have breakpoints that are forced. For example, 120% combat EHR on Black Swan to maximize her passive EHR to DMG
      conversion, and to land Arcana stacks. Failing to reach the breakpoint will penalize the DPS Score for the missing percentage. This penalty applies to
      both the original character and the benchmark simulations but not the baseline.</5><6>Formula</6><7>The resulting formula is:</7><8><0>If DMG &lt; 100%
      benchmark</0><1><0><0>DMG Score = (character dmg - 0% baseline dmg) / (100% benchmark dmg - 0% baseline dmg)</0></0></1></8><9><0>If DMG ≥ 100%
      benchmark</0><1><0><0>DMG Score = 1 + (character dmg - 100% benchmark dmg) / (200% perfect dmg - 100% benchmark dmg)</0></0></1></9><10>What are the grade
      thresholds?</10><11>Grading is based on the benchmark as 100%.</11><12><0><0><0>WTF+ = 135% ↑ 9%</0><1>WTF  = 126% ↑ 8%</1><2>SSS+ = 118% ↑ 7%</2><3>SSS 
      = 111% ↑ 6%</3><4>SS+  = 105% ↑ 5%</4><5>SS   = 100% [Benchmark]</5><6>S+   = 95%</6><7>S    = 90%</7><8>A+   = 85%</8></0><1><0>A  = 80%</0><1>B+ =
      75%</1><2>B  = 70%</2><3>C+ = 65%</3><4>C  = 60%</4><5>D+ = 55%</5><6>D  = 50%</6><7>F+ = 45%</7><8>F  = 40%</8></1></0></12>
    FAQ: >-
      <0>FAQs</0><1>Why does the sim match speed?</1><2>Speed is controlled separately from the other stats because damage isn't comparable between different
      speed thresholds. For example, higher speed can actually result in lower damage with Bronya as a teammate if the speed tuning is thrown off. To make
      damage comparisons fair, we equalize the speed variable by forcing the sim's substats to match the original character's combat speed.</2><3>Why does a
      build score lower even though it has higher Sim Damage?</3><4>The benchmark sims have to equalize speed, so if the higher damage build has lower speed,
      then it will be compared to benchmark builds at that same lower speed, and therefore may score lower. In general this means that the sim will reallocate
      every reduced speed roll into a damage stat instead.</4><5>What's the reasoning behind the benchmark simulation rules?</5><6>The simulation rules were
      designed to create a realistic benchmark build for 100% DPS Score, which should be difficult to achieve yet possible with character investment. After
      trialing many methodologies for generating simulation stats, this set of rules produced the most consistent and reasonable 100% benchmarks across all
      characters and builds.</6><7>The spread of 2 substats across all stat options provides some baseline consistency, and simulates how substats are
      imperfectly distributed in actual player builds. The spread rolls also help to balance out characters that are more stat hungry and require multiple stats
      to be effective, vs characters that only need two or three stats.</7><8>Applying diminishing returns to high stacking substats is a way to make the
      benchmark fair for characters that primarily scale off of a single stat, for example Boothill and break effect. The ideal distribution will want every
      relic roll to go into break effect, but stacking 5x rolls of a single stat on a relic is extremely rare / unrealistic in practice, so the simulation rules
      add diminishing returns to account for that.</8><9>Why are the scores different for different teams?</9><10>Team buffs and synergy will change the ideal
      benchmark simulation's score. For example, a benchmark sim with Fu Xuan on the team may invest more substats into Crit DMG instead of Crit Rate since her
      passive Crit Rate will change the optimal distribution of crit rolls. Teams should be customized to fit the actual teammates used for the character ingame
      for an accurate score.</10><11>Why are certain stat breakpoints forced?</11><12>The only forced breakpoints currently are Effect Hit Rate minimums for DoT
      characters. Take Black Swan for example, the purpose of forcing the sim to use her 120% breakpoint is so it can't just ignore EHR to chase more maximum
      DoT damage. EHR is more than just DMG conversion as it also lets her land Arcana debuffs to reach her 7th Arcana stack for DEF pen. The penalty is
      calculated as a 1% deduction per missing roll from the breakpoint.</12><13><0>dmg scale = min(1, (breakpoint - combat stat) / (min stat
      value))</0></13><14>How were the default simulation teams / sets chosen?</14><15>The defaults come from a combination of usage statistics and community
      guidance. Best in slot sets and teammates will change with new game updates, so the default parameters may also change. Please visit the Discord server
      for suggestions and feedback on the scoring design.</15><16>Why is a character scoring low?</16><17>The `Damage Upgrades` section will give a quick
      overview of the sets and stats that could be improved. Substat upgrades will show the damage increase for a single max roll. For a more detailed
      explanation, the full simulation is detailed below the character card, including the benchmark character's stat distribution, basic stats, combat stats,
      and main stats. Comparing the original character's stats to the benchmark character's stats is helpful to show the difference in builds and see where to
      improve.</17><18>An often underestimated component of the build is completed BiS set effects. Set effects can play a large part in optimizing a
      character's potential damage output and rainbow or broken sets will often score worse than full sets.</18>
