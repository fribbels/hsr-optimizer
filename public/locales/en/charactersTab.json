      "FAQ": "<0>FAQs</0><1>Why does the sim match speed?</1><2>Speed is controlled separately from the other stats because damage isn't comparable between different speed thresholds. For example, higher speed can actually result in lower damage with Bronya as a teammate if the speed tuning is thrown off. To make damage comparisons fair, we equalize the speed variable by forcing the sim's substats to match the original character's combat speed.</2><3>Why does a build score lower even though it has higher Sim Damage?</3><4>The benchmark sims have to equalize speed, so if the higher damage build has lower speed, then it will be compared to benchmark builds at that same lower speed, and therefore may score lower. In general this means that the sim will reallocate every reduced speed roll into a damage stat instead.</4><5>What's the reasoning behind the benchmark simulation rules?</5><6>The simulation rules were designed to create a realistic benchmark build for 100% DPS Score, which should be difficult to achieve yet possible with character investment. After trialing many methodologies for generating simulation stats, this set of rules produced the most consistent and reasonable 100% benchmarks across all characters and builds.</6><7>The spread of 2 substats across all stat options provides some baseline consistency, and simulates how substats are imperfectly distributed in actual player builds. The spread rolls also help to balance out characters that are more stat hungry and require multiple stats to be effective, vs characters that only need two or three stats.</7><8>Applying diminishing returns to high stacking substats is a way to make the benchmark fair for characters that primarily scale off of a single stat, for example Boothill and break effect. The ideal distribution will want every relic roll to go into break effect, but stacking 5x rolls of a single stat on a relic is extremely rare / unrealistic in practice, so the simulation rules add diminishing returns to account for that.</8><9>Why are the scores different for different teams?</9><10>Team buffs and synergy will change the ideal benchmark simulation's score. For example, a benchmark sim with Fu Xuan on the team may invest more substats into Crit DMG instead of Crit Rate since her passive Crit Rate will change the optimal distribution of crit rolls. Teams should be customized to fit the actual teammates used for the character ingame for an accurate score.</10><11>Why are certain stat breakpoints forced?</11><12>The only forced breakpoints currently are Effect Hit Rate minimums for DoT characters. Take Black Swan for example, the purpose of forcing the sim to use her 120% breakpoint is so it can't just ignore EHR to chase more maximum DoT damage. EHR is more than just DMG conversion as it also lets her land Arcana debuffs to reach her 7th Arcana stack for DEF pen. The penalty is calculated as a 1% deduction per missing roll from the breakpoint.</12><13><0>dmg scale = min(1, (breakpoint - combat stat) / (min stat value))</0></13><14>How were the default simulation teams / sets chosen?</14><15>The defaults come from a combination of usage statistics and community guidance. Best in slot sets and teammates will change with new game updates, so the default parameters may also change. Please visit the Discord server for suggestions and feedback on the scoring design.</15><16>Why is a character scoring low?</16><17>The `Damage Upgrades` section will give a quick overview of the sets and stats that could be improved. Substat upgrades will show the damage increase for a single max roll. For a more detailed explanation, the full simulation is detailed below the character card, including the benchmark character's stat distribution, basic stats, combat stats, and main stats. Comparing the original character's stats to the benchmark character's stats is helpful to show the difference in builds and see where to improve.</17><18>An often underestimated component of the build is completed BiS set effects. Set effects can play a large part in optimizing a character's potential damage output and rainbow or broken sets will often score worse than full sets.</18>"
