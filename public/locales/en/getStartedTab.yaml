    <1><0 text="Relic scorer"></0></1> tab, clicking on the Optimize Character
    Stats button will automatically import and run the optimizer on your
    selected character. This option will only be able to use the relics from
    your profile's showcase characters, so it is still recommended to use a
    scanner to import your full inventory of relics, but this allows for a quick
    calculation of character stats in combat.</2>
HowTo:
  Header: How do I use the optimizer?
  Step 1: >-
    <0>Step 1: Import relics</0><1>The optimizer needs a database of relics to
    run against. Install and run one of the relic scanner
    options:</1><2><0></0><1>Kel-Z HSR Scanner (<1 text="Github"></1>)<3><0>OCR
    scanner</0><1>Supports all 16:9 screen resolutions</1></3></1><2>Relic
    Scorer Import (<1><0 text="Relic scorer"></0></1>)<3><0>No download needed,
    but limited to relics from the 8 characters on profile
    showcase</0><1>Imports accurate speed decimals</1></3></2></2>
  Step 2: >-
    <0>Step 2: Select a character</0><1/><2>Select a character and light cone
    from the Character Options menu. Next, use the Recommended Presets button to
    select a preset speed target to optimize for. For most characters, the 133
    speed breakpoint is recommended, and this will set a minimum speed for your
    optimization results. This preset will also automatically fill out the ideal
    main stats and relic set conditionals for the optimizer.</2><3>Once a
    character is chosen, their ability passives and light cone passives can be
    customized. These selectors will affect the final combat stats and damage
    calculations for the character. For the first run these can be left as
    default.</3><4>Most of the Enemy Options and Optimizer Options can be left
    as default to get started. One important option is the Character Priority
    filter setting, which defines which relics the character may steal from
    other characters. Characters can only take relics from lower priority
    characters, so for the first run set this priority to #1, but later on your
    characters list should be ordered by which characters have the highest
    priority for taking gear.</4>
  Step 3: >-
    <0>Step 3: Apply filters</0><1/><2>Main Stats</2><3>The main stat filters
    limits optimizer to using preferred body, feet, planar sphere, and link rope
    main stats. Multiple options can be chosen for each slot. The Recommended
    Presets button will fill these out with each character's ideal stats, but
    these can be customized for other builds.</3><4>Set filters</4><5/><6>The
    relic set filter allows for a combination of 2-piece sets, 4-piece sets, or
    can be left empty. When multiple options are chosen, the search results will
    only show builds with least one of the selected filters active. Conditional
    set effects can be customized from the menu.</6><7>Stat min / max
    filters</7><8>This section defines the minimum / maximum stats to filter the
    results by. Left side is minimum and right side is maximum, both inclusive.
    In this above example, only results with &ge; 134 speed AND &ge; 35% Crit
    Rate are shown. Stat abbreviations are ATK / HP / DEF / SPD / Crit Rate /
    Crit Damage / Effect Hit Rate / Effect RES / Break Effect.</8><9>Important
    note: relics typed in manually or imported with the OCR tool may be affected
    by hidden decimal points for speed that aren't shown by ingame stats. For
    example, 5 star relics can have speed substats of values between 2.0 - 2.6,
    which would all show ingame as 2. This means that speed results should be
    treated as minimum values, as the real value may be slightly higher ingame.
    This also means that maximum filters on speed should be used carefully since
    they may be too restrictive.</9>
  Step 4: >-
    <0>Step 4: Select teammates</0><1/><2>In this menu, select the 3 teammates
    that you're using with the main character. These teammates will apply their
    buffs and passive effects to the calculations. The relic/ornament sets and
    conditionals can be customized to fit the combat scenario.</2>
  Step 5: >-
    <0>Step 5: Save results</0><1/><2>Result rows</2><3>This section displays
    all the results found that match the filters. Every row represents one build
    that was found. The pinned top row shows the character's currently equipped
    build. Clicking on each row will show the relics used in the selected build.
    There may be multiple pages of results, so clicking a column header to sort
    the results by a stat or rating can make it easier to find desired
    builds.</3><4>Permutations</4><5>This section shows the number of
    permutations the optimizer has to search and details on the number of
    matching relics per slot. If any of the numbers are zero, that indicates
    that no relics were found that would satisfy the constraints.</5><6><0>Perms
    - Number of permutations that need to be searched. Stricter filters will
    reduce permutations and search time</0><1>Searched - Number of permutations
    completed in an in-progress search</1><2>Results - Number of displayed
    results that satisfy the stat filters</2></6><7>Selected build</7><8>This
    section displays the selected build from the grid, and which relics are used
    & who they are currently equipped on. Pressing the 'Equip' button will
    assign the relics to the selected character in the optimizer, though the
    ingame character build is not affected.</8>
CharacterTab: >-
  <0>Character tab</0><1/><2>Character priority</2><3>This section displays all
  the optimized characters and their priority order. Characters are added to
  this list from the Optimizer tab, when their filters are applied and 'Start'
  is pressed.</3><4>The ranking is important when used with the 'Priority
  filter' on the Optimizer tab. When enabled, characters may only take relics
  from lower priority characters. For example, the priority #2 character may
  take relics from priority #3, but cannot take from priority #2. Priority #1
  can take from any other character. Rows can be dragged to re-order
  characters.</4><5>The colored highlight on the right of the grid shows the
  equipped item status of the character. In the above example, Jingliu's green
  indicator means she has all 6 relics equipped, Bronya's yellow indicator means
  she is missing at least one relic from her build, and Natasha's red indicator
  means she has no relics equipped.</5><6>Stats summary</6><7>This section
  displays the character's stats with their base stats / light cone / maxed
  traces / and relics equipped in the optimizer. Note that similar to the
  optimizer results, the actual values ingame may be slightly higher than
  displayed here due to hidden decimal values on relic stats.</7>
RelicsTab: >-
  <0>Relics tab</0><1/><2>Relics table</2><3>This section displays all the
  relics that were added / imported into the optimizer. Relics should be updated
  occasionally with the importer to add in newly acquired relics. Clicking
  columns will sort the relics table.</3>
