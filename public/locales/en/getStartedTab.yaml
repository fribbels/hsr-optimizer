    <0>Option 2: One-click-optimize from the Relic Scorer</0><1/><2>From the <1><0 text="Relic scorer"></0></1> tab, clicking on the Optimize Character Stats button will automatically import and run
    the optimizer on your selected character. This option will only be able to use the relics from your profile's showcase characters, so it is still recommended to use a scanner to import your full
    inventory of relics, but this allows for a quick calculation of character stats in combat.</2>
HowTo:
  Header: How do I use the optimizer?
  Step 1: >-
    <0>Step 1: Import relics</0><1>The optimizer needs a database of relics to run against. Install and run one of the relic scanner options:</1><2><0></0><1>Kel-Z HSR Scanner (<1
    text="Github"></1>)<3><0>OCR scanner</0><1>Supports all 16:9 screen resolutions</1></3></1><2>Relic Scorer Import (<1><0 text="Relic scorer"></0></1>)<3><0>No download needed, but limited to
    relics from the 8 characters on profile showcase</0><1>Imports accurate speed decimals</1></3></2></2>
  Step 2: >-
    <0>Step 2: Select a character</0><1/><2>Select a character and light cone from the Character Options menu. Next, use the Recommended Presets button to select a preset speed target to optimize for.
    For most characters, the 133 speed breakpoint is recommended, and this will set a minimum speed for your optimization results. This preset will also automatically fill out the ideal main stats and
    relic set conditionals for the optimizer.</2><3>Once a character is chosen, their ability passives and light cone passives can be customized. These selectors will affect the final combat stats and
    damage calculations for the character. For the first run these can be left as default.</3><4>Most of the Enemy Options and Optimizer Options can be left as default to get started. One important
    option is the Character Priority filter setting, which defines which relics the character may steal from other characters. Characters can only take relics from lower priority characters, so for
    the first run set this priority to #1, but later on your characters list should be ordered by which characters have the highest priority for taking gear.</4>
  Step 3: >-
    <0>Step 3: Apply filters</0><1/><2>Main Stats</2><3>The main stat filters limits optimizer to using preferred body, feet, planar sphere, and link rope main stats. Multiple options can be chosen
    for each slot. The Recommended Presets button will fill these out with each character's ideal stats, but these can be customized for other builds.</3><4>Set filters</4><5/><6>The relic set filter
    allows for a combination of 2-piece sets, 4-piece sets, or can be left empty. When multiple options are chosen, the search results will only show builds with least one of the selected filters
    active. Conditional set effects can be customized from the menu.</6><7>Stat min / max filters</7><8>This section defines the minimum / maximum stats to filter the results by. Left side is minimum
    and right side is maximum, both inclusive. In this above example, only results with &ge; 134 speed AND &ge; 35% Crit Rate are shown. Stat abbreviations are ATK / HP / DEF / SPD / Crit Rate / Crit
    Damage / Effect Hit Rate / Effect RES / Break Effect.</8><9>Important note: relics typed in manually or imported with the OCR tool may be affected by hidden decimal points for speed that aren't
    shown by ingame stats. For example, 5 star relics can have speed substats of values between 2.0 - 2.6, which would all show ingame as 2. This means that speed results should be treated as minimum
    values, as the real value may be slightly higher ingame. This also means that maximum filters on speed should be used carefully since they may be too restrictive.</9>
  Step 4: >-
    <0>Step 4: Select teammates</0><1/><2>In this menu, select the 3 teammates that you're using with the main character. These teammates will apply their buffs and passive effects to the
    calculations. The relic/ornament sets and conditionals can be customized to fit the combat scenario.</2>
  Step 5: >-
    <0>Step 5: Save results</0><1/><2>Result rows</2><3>This section displays all the results found that match the filters. Every row represents one build that was found. The pinned top row shows the
    character's currently equipped build. Clicking on each row will show the relics used in the selected build. There may be multiple pages of results, so clicking a column header to sort the results
    by a stat or rating can make it easier to find desired builds.</3><4>Permutations</4><5>This section shows the number of permutations the optimizer has to search and details on the number of
    matching relics per slot. If any of the numbers are zero, that indicates that no relics were found that would satisfy the constraints.</5><6><0>Perms - Number of permutations that need to be
    searched. Stricter filters will reduce permutations and search time</0><1>Searched - Number of permutations completed in an in-progress search</1><2>Results - Number of displayed results that
    satisfy the stat filters</2></6><7>Selected build</7><8>This section displays the selected build from the grid, and which relics are used & who they are currently equipped on. Pressing the 'Equip'
    button will assign the relics to the selected character in the optimizer, though the ingame character build is not affected.</8>
CharacterTab: >-
  <0>Character tab</0><1/><2>Character priority</2><3>This section displays all the optimized characters and their priority order. Characters are added to this list from the Optimizer tab, when their
  filters are applied and 'Start' is pressed.</3><4>The ranking is important when used with the 'Priority filter' on the Optimizer tab. When enabled, characters may only take relics from lower
  priority characters. For example, the priority #2 character may take relics from priority #3, but cannot take from priority #2. Priority #1 can take from any other character. Rows can be dragged to
  re-order characters.</4><5>The colored highlight on the right of the grid shows the equipped item status of the character. In the above example, Jingliu's green indicator means she has all 6 relics
  equipped, Bronya's yellow indicator means she is missing at least one relic from her build, and Natasha's red indicator means she has no relics equipped.</5><6>Stats summary</6><7>This section
  displays the character's stats with their base stats / light cone / maxed traces / and relics equipped in the optimizer. Note that similar to the optimizer results, the actual values ingame may be
  slightly higher than displayed here due to hidden decimal values on relic stats.</7>
RelicsTab: >-
  <0>Relics tab</0><1/><2>Relics table</2><3>This section displays all the relics that were added / imported into the optimizer. Relics should be updated occasionally with the importer to add in newly
  acquired relics. Clicking columns will sort the relics table.</3>
