  BuildAnalysis:
    ScoringNote: >-
      DPS Score rates build quality by comparing an ability rotation's damage to benchmark builds with the same team / lightcones / eidolons.
      Scores and Combo DMG are measured relative only to the chosen team setup, and should not be compared across different configurations.
    RelicRarityHeader: Relic rarity upgrade comparisons
    RelicRarityNote: |-
      Estimated TBP measures the expected farming time in Days and Trailblaze Power required to upgrade each relic based on the character's stat weights.
      This is a metric of statistical rarity for farming prioritization, and does not reflect nor have an impact on DPS Score and Combo DMG.
