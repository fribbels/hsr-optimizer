  Title: Rating filters
  p1: >-
    Ehp
    - Effective HP, measuring how tanky a max level character is. Calculated using HP & DEF & damage reduction passives
  p2: >-
    Basic / Skill / Ult / Fua (Follow-up attack) / Dot (Damage over time) / Break (Weakness Break)
    - Skill damage calculations, based on the environmental factors in character passives / light cone passives / enemy options.
  p3: >-
    Heal / Shield
    - Other ability calculations, based on the environmental factors in character passives / light cone passives / enemy options.
CombatBuffs:
  Title: Combat buffs
  p1: Additional team buffs to apply to the calculations. Note that buffs from character / light cone self-buffs and passives and traces are already included in calculations.
ComboFilters:
  Title: Combo rotation
  p1: Define the ability rotation to measure Combo DMG. Rotations are defined with [ as the start of a turn, and ] as the end of a turn. See the Advanced Rotation menu and user guide for more details.
  p2: The "Presets" option allows you to disable the pre-processor if you so desire.
StatFilters:
  Title: Stat filters
  p1: Min (left) / Max (right) filters for character stats, inclusive. The optimizer will only show results within these ranges
  p2: Stat abbreviations are ATK / HP / DEF / SPD / Crit Rate / Crit Damage / Effect Hit Rate / Effect RES / Break Effect / Energy Regeneration Rate
  p3: "NOTE: Ingame speed decimals are truncated so you may see speed values ingame higher than shown here. This is because the OCR importer can't detect the hidden decimals."
Mainstats:
  Title: Main stats
  p1: Select main stats to use for optimization search. Multiple values can be selected for more options
Sets:
  Title: Sets
  p1: Select the relic and ornament sets to filter results by. Multiple sets can be selected for more options
  p2: Set effects will be accounted for in calculations, use the Conditional set effects menu to customize which effects are active.
Character:
  Title: Character
  p1: Select the character and eidolon. Character is assumed to be level 80 with maxed traces in optimization calcs.
CharacterPassives:
  Title: Character passives
  p1: Select the conditional effects to apply to the character.
  p2: Effects that rely on combat stats or environment state will be applied by default, so only the options that require user input are listed here.
LightconePassives:
  Title: Light cone passives
  p1: Select the conditional effects to apply to the light cone.
  p2: Effects that rely on combat stats or environment state will be applied by default, so only the options that require user input are listed here.
Lightcone:
  Title: Light cone
  p1: Select the light cone and superimposition. Light cone is assumed to be level 80 in optimization calcs.
  p2: Passive effects are applied under the Light cone passives panel.
Actions:
  Title: Actions
  p1: Equip - Equip the selected relics from the grid onto the character
  p2: Filter - Re-apply the search filters to existing results. Use this to narrow filters without restarting a search
  p3: Pin build - Pin the currently selected row to the top of the grid. Use this to compare multiple builds more easily
  p4: Clear pins - Clear all the builds that you pinned to the top of the grid
OptimizerOptions:
  Title: Optimizer options
  PriorityFilter: >-
    <0>Character priority filter</0> - When this option is enabled, the character may only steal relics from lower priority characters. The optimizer will ignore relics equipped by higher priority
    characters on the list. Change character ranks from the priority selector or by dragging them on the Characters page.
  BoostMain: >-
    <0>Boost main stat</0> - Calculates relic mains stats as if they were this level (or their max if they can't reach this level) if they are currently below it. Substats are not changed accordingly,
    so builds with lower level relics may be stronger once you level them.
  KeepCurrent: <0>Keep current relics</0> - The character must use its currently equipped items and the optimizer will try to fill in empty slots
  AllowEquipped: <0>Allow equipped relics</0> - When enabled, the optimizer will allow using relics that are currently equipped by a character for the search. Otherwise equipped relics are excluded
  Priority: "<0>Priority</0> - See: Character priority filter. Changing this setting will change the character's priority"
  Exclude: <0>Exclude</0> - Select specific characters' equipped relics to exclude for the search. This setting overrides the priority filter
  Enhance: <0>Enhance / rarity</0> - Select the minimum enhance to search for and minimum stars for relics to include
  DPSMode: <0>DPS mode</0> - Select whether the character should be the primary target for supportive buffs (Main DPS) or not (Sub DPS) for optimizer stat calculations
Relics:
  Title: Relics
  p1: >-
    Note - Potential is a percent rating which compares a relic to the best possible +15 relic for the current character in the slot. This rating is based off the scoring algorithm weights. This means
    unrolled relics at +0 sometimes have a higher potential than existing +15 relics, because their possible rolls can go into the character's desired stats.
  p2: "Selected character: Score - The relic's current score as defined by the scoring algorithm for the currently selected character"
  p3: "Selected character: Average potential - The relic's potential at its maximum level, averaged across all the possible rolls it could have on the way to +15"
  p4: "Selected character: Max potential - The relic's maximum potential if all future rolls went into the character's desired stats"
  p5: 'All characters: Max potential - The highest possible potential value of the relic, out of all characters in the game.'
OptimizationDetails:
  Title: Optimization details
  p1: Shows how many relics are being used in the optimization search, after all filters are applied
  p2: Perms - Number of permutations that need to be searched. Narrow your filters to reduce permutations & search time
  p3: Searched - Number of permutations already searched
  p4: Results - Number of displayed results that satisfy the stat filters
EnemyOptions:
  Title: Enemy options
  p1: Level - Enemy level, affects enemy DEF calculations
  p2: Effect RES - Enemy effect RES. Effect res is used for calculations relating to DOT damage
  p3: Damage RES - Enemy elemental RES. RES is set to 0 when the enemy's elemental weakness is enabled.
  p4: Max toughness - Enemy's maximum toughness bar value. Affects calculations related to break damage.
  p5: Targets - Number of targets in the battle. The target enemy is always assumed to be in the center, and damage calculations are only for the single primary target.
  p6: Elemental weakness - Whether the enemy is weak to the character's type. Enabling this sets enemy elemental RES % to 0.
  p7: Weakness broken - Whether the enemy's toughness bar is broken. Affects damage calculations and certain character passives.
SubstatWeightFilter:
  Title: Substat weight filter
  p1: This filter is used to reduce the number of permutations the optimizer has to process.
  p2: It works by first scoring each relic per slot by the weights defined, then filtering by the number of weighted min rolls the relic has.
  p3: Only relics that have more than the specified number of weighted rolls will be used for the optimization search.
  p4: >-
    Note that setting the minimum rolls too high may result in some builds not being displayed,
    if the filter ends up excluding a key relic. Use this filter with caution, but on large searches it makes
    a large impact on reducing search time.
StatDisplay:
  Title: Stat and filter view
  p1: This allows for switching between viewing results as Base stats vs Combat stats. Stat filters will also be applied to the selected view.
  p2: Base stats - The stats as shown on the character's screen ingame, with no in-combat buffs applied.
  p3: "Combat stats - The character's stats with all stat modifiers in combat included: ability buffs, character & light cone passives, teammates, conditional set effects, etc."
ValueColumns:
  Title: Value Columns
  p1: You can optionally display a number of columns that assess the relative 'value' of a relic.
  p2: Potential
  p3: Potential is a character-specific percentage of how good the relic could be (or 'is', if fully upgraded), compared against the stats on a fully upgraded 'perfect' relic in that slot.
  p4: Potential can look at all characters or just owned. It then takes the maximum percentage for any character.
  p5: Potential is useful for finding relics that aren't good on any character, or hidden gems that could be great when upgraded.
  p6: 'Note: ordering by potential can be mismatched against weights, due to weight calculations preferring lower weight ideal mainstats.'
RelicInsights:
  Title: Relic Insight
  p1: When a relic is selected in the table above, you can choose an analysis to view a plot of.
  p2: >-
    'Buckets' looks at how perfect this relic could be (with the best possible upgrade rolls) for each character, and buckets them into percentages.<1/>If you hover over a character portrait you'll
    see the new stats and/or rolls necessary to reach the max potential of this relic.<3/>⚠️ Relics with missing substats may have misleadingly high buckets, as best-case upgrade analysis assumes the
    best new substat per character.
  p3: "Top 10 takes the top 10 characters that this relic could be best for, and shows the range of \"% perfection\" upgrading this relic could result in."
RelicLocation:
  Title: Relic Location
  p1: When a relic is selected in the grid, its position in the ingame inventory is displayed here.
  p2: If the set / part filters are active, apply those same filters ingame, then sort by Date Obtained (newest first) to find the relic.
  p3: ⚠️Usage notes⚠️
  p4: This is only supported with Reliquary Archiver import
  p5: If new relics were deleted or obtained since the last import, they must be re-scanned and imported
  p6: Select the appropriate Inventory width setting to get accurate locations. The width depends on the ingame screen and menu width
LocatorParams:
  Title: Relic Locator Options
  p1: <0>Inventory Width</0> - Select the number of columns the inventory has ingame so that the relic locator can find your relic accurately
  p2: <0>Auto Filter rows</0> - Maximum number of rows before the relic locator applies a part/set filter to try and bring the searched relic closer to the top of your inventory
