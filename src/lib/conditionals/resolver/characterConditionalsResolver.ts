/**
 * Writing conditional text guidelines:
 *
 * DEF shred for debuffs, DEF PEN for buffs. Same for RES shred / RES PEN
 * Basic / Skill / Ult / DoT / FuA
 * Stats uppercased HP / DEF / ATK / CR / SPD / etc
 * Buff for actual stat buffs that last x turns or named buffs. Boost for DMG boost or other non visible buffs.
 * (force weakness break) on abilities that require broken targets / super break
 * Spaces between slashes CR / CD
 * Default RES is (dmg) RES, eff res is Effect RES
 * RNG hits are “x extra hits”
 * If a conditional has more than one buff effect, just consolidate as “buffs”
 * Techniques / start of fight buffs are called Initial buffs
