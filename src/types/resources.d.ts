        "HowIsCalculatedPart1": "<0>How is it calculated?</0><1>At its heart, this score is calculated using a Basic / Skill / Ult / FuA / DoT / Break ability damage rotation predefined per character. These simulations use the optimizer's default conditional settings for the character / teammates / light cones / relic sets, and the damage sum is then used to compare between builds.</1><2>Simulation benchmarks</2><3>The scoring algorithm generates three builds to measure the damage of the original character against.</3><4><0>Baseline (0%) - No substats, no main stats</0><1>Benchmark (100%) - A strong build, generated following certain rules with a realistic distribution of 48x min rolls</1><2>Perfection (200%) - The perfect build, generated with an ideal distribution of 54x max rolled substats</2></4><5>The original character's build is scored based on how its Combo DMG compares to the benchmark percentages.The benchmark and perfection builds will always match the original character's SPD.</5>",
        "HowIsCalculatedPart2": "<0>100% benchmark ruleset</0><1>The 100% benchmark character is designed to be a strong and realistic build that is difficult to reach, but attainable with some character investment into relic farming. The following ruleset defines how the build is generated and why it differs from the perfect build.</1><2><0>The default damage simulation uses a common team composition and the character's BiS relic + ornament set</0><1>The 100% benchmark uses the same eidolon and superimposition as the original character, at level 80 and maxed traces</1><2>The 100% benchmark has 4 main stats and 48 total substats: 8 from each gear slot</2><3>Each substat is equivalent to a 5 star relic's low roll value, except for SPD which uses mid rolls</3><4>First, 2 substats are allocated to each substat type, except for SPD</4><5>Substats are then allocated to SPD to match the original character's in-combat SPD</5><6>The remaining substats are then distributed to the other stats options to maximize the build's damage output</6><7>The resulting build must be a substat distribution that is possible to make with the in-game sub and main stat restrictions (for example, relics with a main stat cannot also have the same substat, and no duplicate substat slots per piece, etc)</7><8>An artificial diminishing returns penalty is applied to substats with greater than <1>12 - (2 * main stats)</1> rolls, to simulate the difficulty of obtaining multiple rolls in a single stat</8></2><3>This process is repeated through all the possible main stat permutations and substat distributions until the highest damage simulation is found.

        "HowIsCalculatedPart3": "<0>Score normalization</0><1>All simulation scores are normalized by deducting a baseline damage simulation. The baseline uses the same eidolon and light cone, but no main stats and no substats. This adjusts for the base amount of damage that a character's kit deals, so that the DPS Score can then measure the resulting damage contribution of each additional substat.</1><2>Relic / ornament sets</2><3>Each character has a defined BiS set, and a few other equivalent sets that can be considered similar in performance. If the original character's sets matches any of the acceptable sets, the character will be scored against a benchmark generated matching that set, otherwise the original character will be scored against the BiS.</3><4>Stat breakpoint penalty</4><5>Certain characters will have breakpoints that are forced. For example, 120% combat EHR on Black Swan to maximize her passive EHR to DMG conversion, and to land Arcana stacks. Failing to reach the breakpoint will penalize the DPS Score for the missing percentage. This penalty applies to both the original character and the benchmark simulations but not the baseline.</5><6>Formula</6><7>The resulting formula is:</7><8><0>If DMG &lt; 100% benchmark</0><1><0><0>DMG Score = (character dmg - 0% baseline dmg) / (100% benchmark dmg - 0% baseline dmg)</0></0></1></8><9><0>If DMG ≥ 100% benchmark</0><1><0><0>DMG Score = 1 + (character dmg - 100% benchmark dmg) / (200% perfect dmg - 100% benchmark dmg)</0></0></1></9><10>What are the grade thresholds?</10><p>Grading is based on the benchmark as 100%.</p><11><0><0><0>WTF+ = 135% ↑ 9%</0><1>WTF  = 126% ↑ 8%</1><2>SSS+ = 118% ↑ 7%</2><3>SSS  = 111% ↑ 6%</3><4>SS+  = 105% ↑ 5%</4><5>SS   = 100% [Benchmark]</5><6>S+   = 95%</6><7>S    = 90%</7><8>A+   = 85%</8></0><1><0>A  = 80%</0><1>B+ = 75%</1><2>B  = 70%</2><3>C+ = 65%</3><4>C  = 60%</4><5>D+ = 55%</5><6>D  = 50%</6><7>F+ = 45%</7><8>F  = 40%</8></1></0></11>",
        "FAQ": "<0>FAQs</0><1>Why does the sim match speed?</1><2>Speed is controlled separately from the other stats because damage isn't comparable between different speed thresholds. For example, higher speed can actually result in lower damage with Bronya as a teammate if the speed tuning is thrown off. To make damage comparisons fair, we equalize the speed variable by forcing the sim's substats to match the original character's combat speed.</2><3>Why does a build score lower even though it has higher Sim Damage?</3><4>The benchmark sims have to equalize speed, so if the higher damage build has lower speed, then it will be compared to benchmark builds at that same lower speed, and therefore may score lower. In general this means that the sim will reallocate every reduced speed roll into a damage stat instead.</4><5>What's the reasoning behind the benchmark simulation rules?</5><6>The simulation rules were designed to create a realistic benchmark build for 100% DPS Score, which should be difficult to achieve yet possible with character investment. After trialing many methodologies for generating simulation stats, this set of rules produced the most consistent and reasonable 100% benchmarks across all characters and builds.</6><7>The spread of 2 substats across all stat options provides some baseline consistency, and simulates how substats are imperfectly distributed in actual player builds. The spread rolls also help to balance out characters that are more stat hungry and require multiple stats to be effective, vs characters that only need two or three stats.</7><8>Applying diminishing returns to high stacking substats is a way to make the benchmark fair for characters that primarily scale off of a single stat, for example Boothill and break effect. The ideal distribution will want every relic roll to go into break effect, but stacking 5x rolls of a single stat on a relic is extremely rare / unrealistic in practice, so the simulation rules add diminishing returns to account for that.</8><9>Why are the scores different for different teams?</9><10>Team buffs and synergy will change the ideal benchmark simulation's score. For example, a benchmark sim with Fu Xuan on the team may invest more substats into Crit DMG instead of Crit Rate since her passive Crit Rate will change the optimal distribution of crit rolls. Teams should be customized to fit the actual teammates used for the character ingame for an accurate score.</10><11>Why are certain stat breakpoints forced?</11><12>The only forced breakpoints currently are Effect Hit Rate minimums for DoT characters. Take Black Swan for example, the purpose of forcing the sim to use her 120% breakpoint is so it can't just ignore EHR to chase more maximum DoT damage. EHR is more than just DMG conversion as it also lets her land Arcana debuffs to reach her 7th Arcana stack for DEF pen. The penalty is calculated as a 1% deduction per missing roll from the breakpoint.</12><13><0>dmg scale = min(1, (breakpoint - combat stat) / (min stat value))</0></13><14>How were the default simulation teams / sets chosen?</14><15>The defaults come from a combination of usage statistics and community guidance. Best in slot sets and teammates will change with new game updates, so the default parameters may also change. Please visit the Discord server for suggestions and feedback on the scoring design.</15><16>Why is a character scoring low?</16><17>The `Damage Upgrades` section will give a quick overview of the sets and stats that could be improved. Substat upgrades will show the damage increase for a single max roll. For a more detailed explanation, the full simulation is detailed below the character card, including the benchmark character's stat distribution, basic stats, combat stats, and main stats. Comparing the original character's stats to the benchmark character's stats is helpful to show the difference in builds and see where to improve.</17><18>An often underestimated component of the build is completed BiS set effects. Set effects can play a large part in optimizing a character's potential damage output and rainbow or broken sets will often score worse than full sets.</18>"

      "Step 2": "<0>Step 2: Select a character</0><1/><2>Select a character and light cone from the Character Options menu. Next, use the Recommended Presets button to select a preset speed target to optimize for. For most characters, the 133 speed breakpoint is recommended, and this will set a minimum speed for your optimization results. This preset will also automatically fill out the ideal main stats and relic set conditionals for the optimizer.</2><3>Once a character is chosen, their ability passives and light cone passives can be customized. These selectors will affect the final combat stats and damage calculations for the character. For the first run these can be left as default.</3><4>Most of the Enemy Options and Optimizer Options can be left as default to get started. One important option is the Character Priority filter setting, which defines which relics the character may steal from other characters. Characters can only take relics from lower priority characters, so for the first run set this priority to #1, but later on your characters list should be ordered by which characters have the highest priority for taking gear.</4>",
      "Step 3": "<0>Step 3: Apply filters</0><1/><2>Main Stats</2><3>The main stat filters limits optimizer to using preferred body, feet, planar sphere, and link rope main stats. Multiple options can be chosen for each slot. The Recommended Presets button will fill these out with each character's ideal stats, but these can be customized for other builds.</3><4>Set filters</4><5/><6>The relic set filter allows for a combination of 2-piece sets, 4-piece sets, or can be left empty. When multiple options are chosen, the search results will only show builds with least one of the selected filters active. Conditional set effects can be customized from the menu.</6><7>Stat min / max filters</7><8>This section defines the minimum / maximum stats to filter the results by. Left side is minimum and right side is maximum, both inclusive. In this above example, only results with &ge; 134 speed AND &ge; 35% Crit Rate are shown. Stat abbreviations are ATK / HP / DEF / SPD / Crit Rate / Crit Damage / Effect Hit Rate / Effect RES / Break Effect.</8><9>Important note: relics typed in manually or imported with the OCR tool may be affected by hidden decimal points for speed that aren't shown by ingame stats. For example, 5 star relics can have speed substats of values between 2.0 - 2.6, which would all show ingame as 2. This means that speed results should be treated as minimum values, as the real value may be slightly higher ingame. This also means that maximum filters on speed should be used carefully since they may be too restrictive.</9>",

The pinned top row shows the character's currently equipped build. Clicking on each row will show the relics used in the selected build. There may be multiple pages of results, so clicking a column header to sort the results by a stat or rating can make it easier to find desired builds.</3><4>Permutations</4><5>This section shows the number of permutations the optimizer has to search and details on the number of matching relics per slot. If any of the numbers are zero, that indicates that no relics were found that would satisfy the constraints.</5><6><0>Perms - Number of permutations that need to be searched.
